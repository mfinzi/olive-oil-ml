# Oil

Library for slowing down deep learning research. Some things are best enjoyed leisurely.

Version -0.1
Currently, automatic installation is broken. You will need to add the location of the github repo to your python path.
For example, I have: export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/marc/pristine-ml/ but you can contact me for more details.

Internal structure is subject to much change, and some of the example experiment files are currently broken.

#To install, run "python setup.py install"
#conda install nodejs
#conda install tqdm
#jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager

Dependencies: Python 3.6, Pytorch 1.0, Pandas, Torchvision, Numpy, (optional) tqdm, (optional) TensorboardX
